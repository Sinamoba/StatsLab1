1. Should you do a linear regression on this data? Explain.   

```{r}
Y <- c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
X <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)
```


```{r}
lm_fit <- lm(Y ~ X)
plot(lm_fit, which = 1)
data.frame(X, Y) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = X, y = Y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```


+ *It is clear from both plots that linear regression is incapable of representing the relationship between the two variables. The first plot shows the linearity of the relationship. For a linear relationship, the points should not form a pattern around the y = 0 line, which is not the case here. The second plot simply shows the scatter-plot of the data and a blue regression line trying to fit it; and failing miserably!*
